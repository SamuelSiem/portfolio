      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>I am just an ordinary kid from Indonesia. Came to Canada in 2015 to pursue my dream to be educated in one of the best universities in the world. And here I am as a UBC graduate class of 2019. A hardworker who have great ambitions and
        million dreams. I am not afraid to set the bar high because if someone can achieve it, why can't I? I love to learn new things because I do not want to feel left out, so I can share and have conversations about what those things are with anyone. Eventhough some of my dreams have already become reality, the list doesn't stop there. I do have plenty more and I would love to tell you about it! So, check me out!</p>

                <p class="skill-desc">Since I do have background in Mathematics, I am in love with numbers. I am amazed by how powerful numbers are. They can tell a story and help not only to make business decisions, but also to make life decisions in general. The important skills that are required in Data Analysis, in my opinion, are problem solving, attention to details, and critical thinking. These so called soft-skills are the key for the hard-skills (i.e. knowledge) to be enhanced.</p>

                <p class="skill-desc">Although I do not have a degree in Computer Science, like most people do nowadays, I am also experienced in programming. I learnt programming mostly through online course, through friends, through hackatons, and through self-development by making my own projects. Moreover, back in the university, I also took many upper level computer science courses, from software engineering to internet computing. Other than because of the high demand of programmer, the reason I enjoy programming is because I like the way I can enhance my creativity and imagination. I believe there is still a lot for me to learn, but with my soft skill to adapt easily, I also believe it will be easy for me to adjust to new programming languages and new projects.</p>

            <p class="job-desc">Although Mathematics is my main major and I am loving it, I chose to take Computer Science and Statistics courses to fulfill my elective requirements. Not only 100-200 levels, but I also took upper-level of CS and STAT since I believe they are important skills to have in this modern world. Coursework includes software engineering, internet computing, algorithms, regressions, data structures, data relationships, statistical inferences and many more. During my three years in UBC, I was also involved in extracurricular activities. I joined team misfits to compete in UBC Nitobe Basketball League and I also joined student clubs such as CCO and BizTech. I also joined hackatons and case competitions like UBC Local Hack, nwHacks, and BizHacks.</p>

In these three terms, I have succeed to complete four Physics courses, four Mathematics courses, and One Computer Science course, along with three other electives. The reason I took core courses was because I was really determined to be transferred to UBC as soon as possible in the engineering program. However, since along the way I pick my interest in Math and Computer Science, I decided to drop my engineering and chose to be a Math major instead. During my 1 year in Langara College, I was active to join basketball intramurals and was a member of the Indonesian Assosication club.</p>
